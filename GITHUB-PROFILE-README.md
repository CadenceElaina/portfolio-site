# Hi, I'm Cadence 👋

Software engineer and former financial professional pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at UNC Charlotte. I build full-stack web applications with JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB — and I also work with Java, Spring Boot, and C#.

Previously spent 3+ years at Wells Fargo Advisors as an Investment Consultant and Financial Advisor — now channeling that domain expertise into software engineering, especially in fintech.

**Currently looking for SWE internship opportunities.**
